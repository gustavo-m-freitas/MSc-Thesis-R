# 📊 MSc Thesis - Volatility Forecasting & Time Series Analysis in R  

This repository is part of my **Master's thesis in Finance** at the **University of Minho**, titled:  
📖 *"Forecasting FTSE-100 Volatility Using HAR-Type Models"*.  

The research explores **16 variations of HAR-based models** to enhance volatility forecasting, incorporating **jumps, signed jumps, realized semivariance, and leverage effects**. The models were tested using multiple loss functions and statistical validation techniques to evaluate predictive performance.

## 📊 Research Overview
This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of HAR-based models in predicting market volatility. The methodology involved:
- **Developing and testing 16 variations of HAR-Type models**, incorporating different decompositions of realized volatility.
- **Analyzing the impact of jumps, signed jumps, and leverage effects** in volatility forecasting.
- **Testing the predictive power of HAR variations** using multiple loss functions and Model Confidence Set (MCS) methodology.

### **HAR-Type Models Used in the Thesis**
The thesis explored 16 variations of the HAR model, including:
- **HAR-RV** → Standard HAR model using realized volatility.
- **HAR-RV-J** → Incorporates jumps as an explanatory variable.
- **HAR-CJ** → Separates realized volatility into continuous and jump components.
- **HAR-RSV** → Uses realized semivariance instead of realized volatility.
- **HAR-RSV-J** → Adds jumps to the realized semivariance model.
- **HAR-RV-SJ** → Uses signed jumps to differentiate between positive and negative impacts.
- **HAR-RV-SSJ (I) & (II)** → Further decomposition of signed jumps into lagged weekly and monthly effects.
- **LHAR Variants** → Each of the above models was also tested with the leverage effect (negative returns).

The results showed that **weekly volatility had the strongest predictive power**, and that **negative realized semivariance and signed jumps provided more information than their positive counterparts**. However, the Model Confidence Set (MCS) analysis indicated that **no single model significantly outperformed all others in out-of-sample forecasting**.
